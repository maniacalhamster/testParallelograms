# testParallelograms
Tests the assigned parallelograms.sh with the public script for all possible inputs (2 to 20)

To use just copy the script into the directory where your parallelograms.sh file is stored (presumably ~/homework/script1/),
chmod to add execute permissions, then run the script with ./scriptnamehere.sh.
